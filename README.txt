Virtual- Health Counselor:	Postpartum-Care, Anxiety and
Stress	  
 
The Chatbot has collection of Prompts  for Generating role-playing scenarios, questions, and instructions related to “Postpartum Care anxiety and stress”. The Chatbot  first try to give Output upon prompt text data. These prompt techniques used with the OpenAI language model Text-davinci-003 and Markdown to Structure and present information in a clear and Organized-Manner. and to generate responses that provide support, advice, and information for new mothers experiencing postpartum anxiety. 
 
I've designed a User Interface(UI) with an Avatar, for the Chatbot model. Along with that I have added Voice Recognition feature, Speak back for Voice Input-Output. 
 
I have used Speech Recognition and for it I have used Google Speech Recognizer. 
 The user can speak and can ask any question just by pressing letter S in the text box, 
the text box takes it as an instruction, to switch for Recording  and analyze the voice to give its Output. 
 
 
I have used PYTTSX3 (Python Text-to-Speech Ver.3) for speaking back the Voice Input and Output. 
 Now, If the user using the chatbot with their voice it is also reading back both, it's Input and the Output. 
 
 
I have used tkinter, to create Interface, created Text box, Output box, Enter Button and an Avatar to interact with. 
 
 
 
Steps to Run: install all the Requirement 
pip install openai pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition 
###### Replace api key 
######## Replace Avatar location
